### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer that loves creating software for daily problems. I currently work with 99designs, an organization who firmly believes that creativity has no borders. We work towards a common goal of being a global creative platform for design needs. Apart from working with these awesome group of people I also have my personal vision ðŸ”­ to contribute towards a better world. Here I am going to describe my personal projects and my current learnings.

#### Projects in progress âš¡
I live to solve problems. I am describing some of the projects I am doing or aspire to do in future and if there is someone out there who would like to collaborate with me on this I would love that.

1. MotionAI
2. Cheaper version of https://noiseaware.io/ for Aussie short term rentals - Probably deploy application using flutter and the hardware will contain a sonic sensor and RPi 4. Mostly because I am really excited to work with Rpi 4 but I am sure the same solution can be made to work with Rpi zero.
3. Homecare services for Indian market
4. Global platform for small Indian artists(carpenters, furniture makers, painters, sculpture artists, jwellery makers, textile experts): Find under-appreciated artists and give them a global platform to sell their goods

#### Learnings ðŸŒ±
- AWS S3 and S3 glacier : Recently worked with a friend on saving daily backups onto S3 and creating policies to transfer that from S3 to S3 glacier which turns out is really cheap. 
- Difference between CPU burst and IOPS burst : Learnt this the hard way but it turns out
- How to deploy a Rpi camera on Jetson nano
- Make Go lambda to trigger an automatic phone call
