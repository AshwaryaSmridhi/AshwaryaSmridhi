### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer that loves creating software for daily problems. I currently work with SEEK. Apart from working with these awesome group of people I also have my personal vision ðŸ”­ to contribute towards a better world. Here I am going to describe my personal projects and my current learnings.

#### Projects in progress âš¡
I live to solve problems. I am describing some of the projects I am doing or aspire to do in future and if there is someone out there who would like to collaborate with me on this I would love that.

1. MotionAI
2. Cheaper version of https://noiseaware.io/ for Aussie short term rentals - Probably deploy application using flutter and the hardware will contain a sonic sensor and RPi 4. Mostly because I am really excited to work with Rpi 4 but I am sure the same solution can be made to work with Rpi zero.
3. Homecare services for disability and aged care.
4. Unseen Market/Local Gems: Global platform for small artists(carpenters, furniture makers, painters, sculpture artists, jwellery makers, textile experts): Find under-appreciated artists and give them a global platform to sell their goods
